# passwordgenerator
This is a one file, password generator, that works on common distros of Linux, as well as Mac OS X
It probably will work on Windows form a `git bash` console window, but I have not tried it. The
limitation for Windows is the lack of a system-wide dictionary, but this program does have the
ability to use any dictionary.

The following is the current help, with an example output.

```
"""
    Usage: passwords [opts]
    Options are:
        -? / --help : you are reading it.
        -n / --number : how many passwords do you want? defaults to 10.
        -z / --min-length : how long must each password be? defaults to 16
        -a / --alphabet : allowed chars in password, defaults to quite
            a few of the printable characters.
        -w / --words : location of the dictionary file.
        -b / --bits : bits of "entropy" required in each password. YES YES
            I know this is not even sort of what is meant by 'entropy' in
            physics, but I also know the word has taken root and it is
            a measure of like, like something. Whatever. Actually. 
    Prints the options and a list of passwords. Example:
    Passwords generated by using the following options:
      --alphabet abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789/+=!~-? --bits 50 --min-length 20 --number 10 --words /usr/share/dict/words
